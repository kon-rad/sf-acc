## Inspiration

Ai is transforming the world, texting with chatGPT and other chatbots is a lot of friction for broad majority of population, a zoom call interface is the next best thing to real world interactions with Ai. This project is a zoom call with Ai agents that can get all your questions answered about San Francisco.


## What it does

This zoom call allows you to talk to the mayor and get the information you need about the city. The news reporter Ai agent will get you the latest news. Ilya Sutskever will talk to you about anything you want but it is especially knowledgable about Ai and the future of humankind with superhuman AGI.

## How we built it

OpenAi, Anthropic, langchain-js, tailwind.

## Challenges we ran into

Lots of tricky things with the UI like streaming responses, displaying the right avatar image from headers passed from backend.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Completed an ai agent web requests, uploaded and indexed douments from crawling sf government websites, have a working UI with multiple ai agents interfacing with voice.

## What we learned

Lots about langchain js agents.
